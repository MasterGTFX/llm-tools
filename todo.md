2. refactor the repo name to "vibe-tools" and the package name to "vibetools" and update all references. refactor the tools naming scheme to "ai_<toolname>" instead of "llm_<toolname>"
3. add a "categorize" tool that takes a list of items and an instruction and optionally a set of categories and returns a mapping of items to categories. if categories are not provided, it should first create the categories based on whole input. we should support optional parameters like "max_categories" and "min_items_per_category" or "allow_unknown" bool. we should expose the internal tools like "add_category", "remove_category", "rename_category", "merge_categories" for categories creation steps. for assigning items to categories, we should do items one-by-one and assign them to best fit categories (mandatory tool call). 
4. add a "map" tool that takes a list of items and an instruction and applies the instruction to each item, returning a list of results. this is similar to "filter" but instead of filtering items, it transforms them. it does the item one-by-one.
5. add a "reduce" tool that takes a list of items and an instruction and reduces the list to a single value based on the instruction. this is similar to "filter" but instead of filtering items, it aggregates them. it does the item one-by-one, maintaining an accumulator. the previous user input and llm output are added to history and passed to the llm for context. \
